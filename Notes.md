Definition:

Software engineering is the combination of "engineering principles" and software development best practices.  

On a functional level this means you "design" your code before you "build" your code.  

It means writing an "outline" and then writing the code.

How to write an outline:

    -main points -> high level specfication
    -examples -> test cases
    -conclusion -> output
    -reference material -> reference material

Process:

Step 1:
Big idea -> "modularize" your idea -> think about expected output for each module -> do the research (google or test program)

Steps 2 - n:
intermediate idea -> modularize further -> think about expectation of ouput -> do research
